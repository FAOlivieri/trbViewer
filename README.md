# trbviewer README

This VSCode extension displays pickled json files with the trb extension generated by RFDiffusion

## Features

The extension will unpickle and display any files with .trb extension opened in VSCode.

## Requirements

Requires python with numpy in the global path

I recommend setting binary default editor in VSCode settings to "default" to avoid the binary file warning.
