# trbviewer README

Extension to enable display of RFDiffusion trb files in VSCode

## Features

The extension will unpickle and display any files with .trb extension opened in VSCode. Larger trb files might take a second to load.

I recommend setting binary default editor in VSCode settings to "default" to avoid the binary file warning.

## Requirements

Requires python with numpy. Looks at the VSCode default interpreter
